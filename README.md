Ben 10 Mini-Movie Website (HTML Project)

This is a fun and creative mini-movie website based on Ben 10, built using only HTML. It’s a storytelling-style site that showcases everything I’ve learned in HTML — from structure and layout to multimedia and forms.

 What This Project Includes

I’ve implemented 13 core HTML concepts, including:

✅ Page structure and semantic tags (`<header>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`)
✅ Headings, paragraphs, and proper content formatting
 ✅ Internal page linking and navigation (`<a href="#">`)
 ✅ Embedded **images**, **audio**, and **video**
 ✅ Use of **iframes** for interactive elements
 ✅ Forms with labeled inputs and a textarea
 ✅ Lists (Ben 10 aliens, episodes, etc.)
 ✅ Tables (e.g., episode schedule or power stats)
 ✅ Commenting and organizing code
 ✅ Proper use of `<div>` for layout
 ✅ Creative storytelling with transitions and scenes
 ✅ Embedding YouTube clips or fictional video clips
 ✅ Accessible design practices

 Why Ben 10?

I chose Ben 10 because:
It’s a nostalgic and action-packed series I enjoy
 It made the project more engaging to build
I could creatively apply HTML concepts in a storyline format
